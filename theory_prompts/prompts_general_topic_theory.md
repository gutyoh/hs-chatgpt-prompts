# Prompts for PROGRAMMING TOPICS creation using ChatGPT

## Initial Conversation prompts

### SYSTEM PROMPT — Act as an experienced CS EdTech Content Creator
> You are an experienced Computer Science EdTech content creator at Hyperskill. Your specific role is to write and create engaging theoretical topics in the ["ENTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME HERE"] programming language about the basics of programming for absolute beginners and provide handy utility features for seasoned developers. Your content must ensure a balanced and inclusive learning experience.

 
### FIRST CHAT PROMPT — Generate non-AI robotic text that fits the Hyperskill style
> When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I will ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
>
> Apart from the previous instructions, the generated text should directly engage the reader. Use 'you' and 'we' to establish a conversational yet instructive tone. Integrate proactive phrases to guide the reader through the topic. The overall tone of the text should have a balance that's neither too casual nor overly formal. Aim for a style that's instructive yet also engaging and direct. It should read like an educational topic rather than a blog post or a dry textbook.
>
> Always ensure you follow the above instructions for any topic theory you generate.

### Generate topic structure for GENERAL SUBJECTS
>I'm working on a topic titled ["ENTER TOPIC TITLE/NAME HERE"] related to ["ENTER GENERAL SUBJECT NAME e.g., 'Essentials/Algorithms/Math/Statistics' HERE"]. I need you to provide a topic structure for it. The topic's first section should be the "Introduction" section, and the last section should be the "Conclusion".
>
>Each section in the topic should delve into the core principles and applications of the concept, maintain a sequential and logical order, and build upon the previous section without redundancy. Aim for a total of 4-6 sections in addition to the "Introduction" and "Conclusion". In your answer, provide the section titles only WITHOUT any additional information or meta-text.

 
### Refine topic structure with specific author instructions
>I need your help to further refine the topic structure provided below:
>
>1. [ENTER A NUMBERED LIST OF TOPIC SECTIONS HERE]
>2. ...
>3. ...
>4. ...
>
>Ideally, the section immediately following the "Introduction" should be ["ENTER THE SECTION THAT SHOULD COME AFTER 'Introduction' HERE"], where we delve into ["ENTER THE 1-2 CONCEPTS OF THE SECTION HERE"].
>
>Subsequent sections should emphasize guiding readers on the practical aspects, such as ["ENTER PRACTICAL ASPECTS HERE, e.g., 'setup/usage' or 'implementation details'"]. You can also highlight sections about limitations and best practices if they are pertinent to the ["ENTER TOPIC NAME/TITLE HERE"] topic. Avoid generic or repetitive titles; each section title should be short but clearly indicate its specific content. There should be NO repetitive sections, and aim for a total of 4-6 sections in addition to the "Introduction" and "Conclusion". In your answer, provide the section titles only WITHOUT any additional information or meta-text.

 
### Generate ENTIRE/FULL topic theory for GENERAL SUBJECTS
>Now, please provide the entire theory for ["ENTER TOPIC TITLE/NAME HERE"] related to ["ENTER GENERAL SUBJECT NAME e.g., 'Essentials/Algorithms/Math/Statistics' HERE"] based on the updated topic structure and strictly follow the guidelines below:
>
>1. [ENTER A NUMBERED LIST OF TOPIC SECTIONS HERE]
>2. ...
>3. ...
>4. ...
>
>Guidelines for generating the theory:
>- **Introduction:** Specifically, the "Introduction" section should only have 2 paragraphs of 3-4 lines each; the second paragraph should use a phrase like "In this topic, you'll learn..." to introduce what the reader will learn throughout the topic.
>
>- **Theory Depth:** Each subsequent section should contain an in-depth and very comprehensive theory explanation. First, explain the core concepts of the section, then provide relevant details and examples, concluding each section with a summary.
>
>- **Theory Length:** The content of each section MUST ALWAYS contain at least 4-5 paragraphs of 5-6 text lines each. Ensure that every section offers a comprehensive understanding of its topic, leaving no room for ambiguities.
>
>- **Logical Sequence:** Ensure that each section of the topic logically progresses from the previous one, and there's no repeated text from earlier sections. Use smooth transitions between each section to maintain flow.
>
>- **Visual Cues:** Integrate visual components, line breaks, or cues throughout the topic to enhance reader engagement.
>
>- **Formatting:** Use **bold** for new and important terms, *italics* for emphasis or when introducing new concepts, and `code` when referencing specific terms or concepts that need distinction.
>
>- **Best Practices Section:** If the above topic structure includes a "Best Practices" section, provide a list of practices in the format "Practice Title: Explanation". Each best practice should be concise and directly relevant to the topic.
>
>- **Conclusion:** Summarize the key terms, main points, and the relevance of understanding the topic in the conclusion.

 
### Instruct ChatGPT to rewrite GENERAL SUBJECTS theory based on author's domain of knowledge
>Below is the entire topic theory of the ["ENTER SECTION TITLE/NAME HERE"] section that you previously generated:

>3. ...
>4. ...

 
### Instruct ChatGPT to review and rewrite GENERAL SUBJECTS theory on its own — ⚠️ NOT 100% RELIABLE ⚠️
>Below is the entire theory of the ["ENTER SECTION TITLE/NAME HERE"] section that you previously generated:

>
>---
>
>Now, please refine the above theory following these instructions:
>
>- Identify any theory gaps or ambiguous information and rectify them with comprehensive details relevant to the current section.
>- Ensure a coherent flow of information, avoiding jargon unless necessary, and providing clear explanations for any complex terms.
>- Ensure you use appealing but not overly powerful phrases in the theory to present any new or subsequent explanations.
