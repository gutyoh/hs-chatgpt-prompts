# Prompts for PROGRAMMING TOPICS theory creation using ChatGPT

## Initial Conversation prompts

### SYSTEM PROMPT — Act as an experienced CS EdTech Content Creator
> You are an experienced Computer Science EdTech content creator at Hyperskill. Your specific role is to write and create engaging theoretical topics in the ["ENTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME HERE"] programming language about the basics of programming for absolute beginners and provide handy utility features for seasoned developers. Your content must ensure a balanced and inclusive learning experience.

 
### FIRST CHAT PROMPT — Generate non-AI robotic text that fits the Hyperskill style
> When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I will ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
>
> Apart from the previous instructions, the generated text should directly engage the reader. Use 'you' and 'we' to establish a conversational yet instructive tone. Integrate proactive phrases to guide the reader through the topic. The overall tone of the text should have a balance that's neither too casual nor overly formal. Aim for a style that's instructive yet also engaging and direct. It should read like an educational topic rather than a blog post or a dry textbook.
>
> Always ensure you follow the above instructions for any topic theory you generate.

### Generate topic structure
>I'm working on a topic titled ["ENTER TOPIC TITLE/NAME HERE"] in the ["ENTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME HERE"] programming language, and I need you to provide a topic structure for it. The topic's first section should be "Introduction" section, and the last section should be "Conclusion".
>
>Each section in the topic should cover practical aspects of the topic, follow a sequential and logical order, and build upon the previous one without being redundant or repetitive. Aim for a total of 4-6 sections in addition to the "Introduction" and "Conclusion". In your answer, provide the section titles only WITHOUT any additional information or meta-text.

 
### Refine topic structure with specific author instructions
>I need your help to further refine the topic structure provided below:
>
>1. [ENTER A NUMBERED LIST OF TOPIC SECTIONS HERE]
>2. ...
>3. ...
>4. ...
>
>Ideally, the section immediately following the "Introduction" should be ["ENTER THE SECTION THAT SHOULD COME AFTER 'Introduction' HERE"], where we delve into ["ENTER THE 1-2 CONCEPTS OF THE SECTION HERE"].
>
>Subsequent sections should emphasize guiding readers on the practical aspects, such as ["ENTER PRACTICAL ASPECTS HERE, e.g., 'setup/usage' or 'implementation details'"]. You can also highlight sections about limitations and best practices if they are pertinent to the ["ENTER TOPIC TITLE/NAME HERE"] topic. Avoid generic or repetitive titles; each section title should be short but clearly indicate its specific content. There should be NO repetitive sections, and aim for a total of 4-6 sections in addition to the "Introduction" and "Conclusion". In your answer, provide the section titles only WITHOUT any additional information or meta-text.

 
### Generate ENTIRE/FULL topic theory for PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE topics
>Now, please provide the entire theory for ["ENTER TOPIC TITLE/NAME HERE"] based on the updated topic structure and strictly follow the guidelines below:
>
>1. [ENTER A NUMBERED LIST OF TOPIC SECTIONS HERE]
>2. ...
>3. ...
>4. ...
>
>Guidelines for generating the theory:
>- Introduction: Specifically, the "Introduction" section should only have 2 paragraphs of 3-4 lines each; the second paragraph should use a phrase like "In this topic, you'll learn..." to introduce what the reader will learn throughout the topic.
>
>- Theory Depth: Each subsequent section should contain an in-depth and very comprehensive theory explanation. First, you should explain the concepts of the section, then you provide details and, if relevant to the topic section, an idiomatic and creative code snippet. Finally, you summarize the information before ending the section.
>
>- Theory Length: The content of each section MUST ALWAYS contain at least 4-5 paragraphs of 5-6 text lines each. You MUST ensure to explain the code snippets You MUST ensure to explain the code snippets comprehensively and that every section provides a comprehensive understanding of its topic, leaving no room for ambiguities.
>
>- Logical Sequence: Each section of the topic should be logically connected to the previous one, and there should NOT be repeated text from previous sections; ensure that you're using smooth transitions between each section.
>
>- Code Snippets: When discussing practical code applications or configurations, always include idiomatic code snippets, ensuring they are clear, concise, and adhere to ["ENTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME HERE"] best practices. These code snippets should not be mere one-liners, but entire full snippets with illustrative examples that help elucidate the topic and that can be copied and pasted into an IDE so they can be executed without errors.
>
>- Best Practices Section: If the above topic structure includes a "Best Practices" section, provide a list of practices in the format "Practice Title: Explanation". Each best practice should be concise and relevant to the topic.
>
>- Visual Cues: Integrate visual components, line breaks, or cues throughout the topic to enhance reader engagement.
>
>- Formatting: Use **bold** for new and important terms, *italics* for folder/file names, paths, or URLs, and `code` for keywords, functions/methods, or library/module names.
>
>- Conclusion: Summarize the key terms, main points, and the relevance of understanding the topic in the conclusion.

 
### Instruct ChatGPT to rewrite theory based on the author's domain of knowledge
>Below is the entire topic theory of the ["ENTER SECTION TITLE/NAME HERE"] section that you previously generated:
>
>["ENTER THE ENTIRE THEORY SECTION TEXT INCLUDING CODE SNIPPETS GENERATED BY CHATGPT HERE"]
>
>---
>
>Now, please slightly refine the above theory following these instructions:
>
>1. [ENTER A NUMBERED LIST OF 2-4 INSTRUCTIONS WITH SPECIFIC CHANGES TO BE MADE TO THE THEORY HERE]
>2. ...
>3. ...
>4. ...

 
### Instruct ChatGPT to review and rewrite theory on its own — ⚠️ NOT 100% RELIABLE ⚠️
>Below is the entire theory of the ["ENTER SECTION TITLE/NAME HERE"] section that you previously generated:

>
>---
>
>Now, please slightly refine the above theory following these instructions:
>
>- Identify any theory gaps or ambiguous information and fix them with comprehensive information relative to the current theory section.
>- Ensure that the code snippet example follows idiomatic practices of the ["ENTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME HERE"] programming language.
>- Ensure you use appealing but not overly powerful phrases in the theory to present code snippets and subsequent explanations.
