# Prompts for Faded Parsons (Fill in the blanks) problems using ChatGPT

## Initial Conversation prompt

### SYSTEM PROMPT ‚Äî Act as an experienced CS EdTech Content Creator
>You are a knowledgeable and creative Computer Science EdTech content creator at Hyperskill. You specialize in creating faded parsons (fill in the blanks) problems in the ["ENTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME HERE"] programming language that are challenging and engaging for learners.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Generating a Faded Parsons problem requires TWO (2) PROMPTS ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. The [PROMPT #1](#prompt-1---generate-code-snippet-related-to-the-topic) generates a code snippet related to the topic and programming language and also identifies 2-3 "important code lines" that GPT will further fade keyword components from.
2. The [PROMPT #2](#prompt-2---generate-the-faded-parsons-problem-and-fade-out-relevant-keywords) instructs GPT to fade out the specific keywords, generate the problem title and description, and provide the code snippet with faded keywords with correct and incorrect options.


### PROMPT #1 - Generate code snippet related to the topic
```
Generate a code snippet for a coding problem following these guidelines:

1. The code snippet MUST BE about the ["ENTER TOPIC TITLE/NAME HERE"] topic from the ["ENTER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE NAME HERE"] programming language.
2. The code snippet MUST BE valid and execute a logical action you would use in a real-world program.
3. The code snippet MUST FOLLOW BEST PRACTICES and BE IDIOMATIC for the language.
4. The code snippet MUST NOT have any comments.
5. The number of lines of code in the code snippet MUST BE between 8 and 15.
6. The code snippet MUST BE without blank lines and use 4 spaces for indents.

---

After generating the code snippet, identify the 2-3 most important code lines that convey a complete action related to the topic STRICTLY FOLLOWING these rules:

1. Each line of code MUST BE valid and work correctly within its context.
2. DO NOT consider standalone symbols like '{', '}', '(', ')', and ';'. FOCUS ONLY on lines that convey a complete code action.
3. The output should ONLY include the following:
 - 3.1 First output the ENTIRE code snippet wrapped in triple backticks '```'
 - 3.2 Then output the key lines of the code snippet as a bullet on a new line.
4. The output MUST NOT include additional text or meta information.
```

### PROMPT #2 - Generate the faded parsons problem and fade out relevant keywords
```
Based on the following code snippet:

["ENTER THE ENTIRE GENERATED CODE SNIPPET FROM THE PREVIOUS CHAT HERE"]

---

Fade out MULTIPLE CODE KEYWORDS from these lines of code below:

 ["ENTER THE MOST IMPORTANT LINES OF CODE HERE
 ...
 ...
 ..."]

Use the following rules to fade out the keywords:

2. Each faded keyword should be UNIQUE. YOU MUST NEVER fade out the same keyword more than once, even if it appears multiple times in the code.

3. For method or function declarations:
 - 3.1 Separate the access modifier, return type, method name, and parameters into distinct components.
 - 3.2 For example, 'public static void main(String[] args)' SHOULD BE separated into components like 'public static', 'void', 'main', and '(String[] args)'.

4. For variable declarations, SPLIT THE TYPE, VARIABLE NAME, and the ASSIGNED VALUE (if any) into distinct components.
5. For method or function calls, separate the object or module name from the method or function.
6. IGNORE standalone characters and DO NOT fade out symbols like '{', '}', '(', ')', ',' and `;`.
7. DO NOT CONSIDER import statements or other boilerplate lines as key components.
8. You MUST APPLY the SAME LOGIC to the provided lines of code, regardless of the programming language.
9. Replace each faded component with the '‚ñ≠' character.

10. The output MUST BE text and have the following format:
 - 10.1 A creative but concise problem question/description. DO NOT include HINTS in the description.
 - 10.2 Output the entire code snippet with the faded components wrapped in triple backticks '```'.
 - 10.3 After generating the problem, create an engaging title based on the problem's content
 - 10.4 The title must be LESS THAN 40 symbols in the format [TITLE] ... [/TITLE] and put the title FIRST in the output.

11. Below the code snippet, output the correct options for each faded component, and then output "similar incorrect/extra options".
```
